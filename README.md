The project before us contains a database of puzzles that must be solved in order to successfully complete the entire challenge.
To implement the project, I used a pre-configured template for two types of puzzles, a question and answer puzzle, and an American question.
Each question has a calculation of how long it took to answer it, and at the end of the program, the total time and the average time per answer are calculated from the total number of questions.
The challenge was keeping your head between so many folders, and especially in the logical implementation of the time calculations.
In addition, it was a little challenging that there were some conflicting instructions.
Everything worked out thanks to organized thinking, logical work, and 'siyata Dishmaya'.
